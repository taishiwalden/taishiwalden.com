## Summary

[Tongue Twista](https://tonguetwista.netlify.app/) is a fast-paced web game I built in just a few hours using Lovable.Dev â€” a platform for rapidly building small creative projects with minimal code overhead. The game is a randomized deck of 30 cards, each featuring a different tongue twister. Users swipe right (or tap the green button) if they pronounce the phrase correctly, or swipe left (red button) if they stumble over the words â€” keeping score as they go.

## Why I Built It
This project was an experiment in "vibe coding" â€” building something fun, fast, and functional without overengineering. I wanted to show how accessible and satisfying it can be to bring a playful concept to life quickly using modern tools.

## What I Learned

* â€¢Â Leveraged Lovable.Dev for rapid prototyping and design
* â€¢Â Focused on UX through swipe gestures and visual feedback

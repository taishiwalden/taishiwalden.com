### User Stories

**Allergy-Friendly Dining** – Users with food allergies (e.g., peanuts, shellfish, dairy) can rate restaurants on their allergy accommodation practices, including menu options and staff knowledge.

**Keto-Friendly Options** – People following a ketogenic diet can find and review restaurants with low-carb, high-fat menu items that align with keto requirements.

**Pescatarian Preferences** – Users can filter and recommend restaurants that offer high-quality pescatarian-friendly meals, helping others find sustainable and diverse fish options.

**Gluten-Free Dining** – Users with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease can find restaurants with gluten-free menu items and rate the restaurant’s adherence to cross-contamination protocols.

**Vegan and Vegetarian Choices** – Users seeking plant-based options can review and recommend eateries based on the variety and quality of vegan or vegetarian dishes.


### Design Elements

**Clear, Icon-Based Filters** – Filters allow users to quickly search for restaurants based on their dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, gluten-free), each represented by clear, intuitive icons.

**Interactive Rating System** – A ratings system lets users evaluate each restaurant’s dietary accommodations, with criteria like "allergy awareness," "menu variety," and "cross-contamination precautions."

**Social and Follower Features** – Users can follow other like-minded individuals, view their restaurant recommendations, and build a community focused on safe, enjoyable dining.

**Map-Based Restaurant Finder** – A location-based map displays restaurants that meet users’ dietary needs, with color-coded pins indicating restriction types.

The Kiuks app design prioritizes inclusivity, usability, and community support, providing a valuable resource for individuals who need or prefer specific dietary accommodations.

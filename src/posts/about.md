# Hey, I'm Taishi üëãüèº

My friends describe me as rambunctious yet disciplined, but more importantly, a life enthusiast. I bring a winning mentality and diligent work ethic, and strive to promote a culture where compassion and collaboration thrive.

After graduating from the University of Washington in May 2022, I joined [Forum Solutions](https://www.forumsolutionsllc.com/), a management consulting firm, as an Analyst, to help organizations solve complex problems with better data, clearer information, and the tools necessary to bring projects to the finish line.

During the first two years, I had the opportunity to work with one of the world's largest apparel brands, with roles spanning agile product development, change management, and ERP system implementations across multiple geographies. I was swiftly promoted to Associate Consultant, where I've delved deeper into technology and retail verticals.

I believe technology has amazing potential to help us improve the world. Pursuing this potential has shaped me into an effective product manager and strategist. In each role I take on, my focus remains on ensuring that business endeavors and outcomes align with a greater purpose and make a tangible difference in people's lives.

How we work together is just as crucial as what we accomplish, and I believe that empathy, radical transparency, and teamwork are fundamental in fostering strong working relationships.

I believe mindfulness is key to success ‚Äì A tenet I pursue through my interests in weightlifting, hiking, [taking photos](https://unsplash.com/@taishiwalden), and exploring the Pacific Northwest and beyond. I love chatting with anyone working on anything interesting, so don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taishiwalden/)! I'd love to explore opportunities to collaborate.
